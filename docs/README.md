<summary>Why <code>throne-trader</code>?</summary>

<br>

<i>This name draws inspiration from the "Game of Thrones" series, where various characters vie for the Iron Throne, 
symbolizing power, wealth, and influence.
<br><br>
"ThroneTrader" signifies the algorithm's quest for dominance in the financial markets.
<br><br>
It suggests that my trading algorithm is on a mission to conquer the markets and achieve victory, 
much like the characters in the show strive to sit upon the Iron Throne.</i>
