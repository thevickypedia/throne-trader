    Args:
        symbol: Stock ticker.
        logger: Logger object.
        threshold: Limit used to classify predicted price differences into trading signals based on their significance.

    See Also:
        - By adjusting the threshold value, you can control the sensitivity of the trading signals.
        - | A higher threshold would lead to fewer and stronger signals,
          | indicating more significant price movements required to trigger a signal.
        - A lower threshold would result in more frequent signals, capturing smaller price fluctuations.
        - | The choice of the threshold value depends on your risk tolerance, trading strategy,
          | and the volatility of the stock being analyzed.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, str]:
        A dictionary containing the prediction signal for the next two days.
