    """Get buy, sell, and hold signals using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) strategy.

    Args:
        symbol: Stock ticker.
        logger: Logger object.
        bar_count: Number of bars from yfinance.
        days: Number of days to consider.

    See Also:
        - A larger ``bar_count``/``days`` gives longer historical data for trend analysis.
        - A smaller count focuses on recent data for short-term signals.
        - Experiment and backtest to find the best fit for your approach.
        - | Short-term EMA (12-day EMA): A smaller span value for the short-term EMA means that it reacts more quickly
          | to recent price changes. This can lead to more frequent and sensitive crossovers between the MACD line and
          | the Signal line, resulting in more buy and sell signals. However, it might also generate more false signals
          | in volatile markets.
        - | Long-term EMA (26-day EMA): A larger span value for the long-term EMA makes it smoother and less reactive
          | to short-term price fluctuations. This helps in identifying the long-term trends in the stock's price
          | movement. However, a larger span might result in delayed signals and could miss some short-term trends.
        - | Crossover Sensitivity: When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, it generates a bullish
          | signal (buy), and when it crosses below the long-term EMA, it generates a bearish signal (sell).
          | The span value influences how quickly these crossovers occur. A smaller span makes crossovers more
          | sensitive, potentially leading to more frequent signals.
